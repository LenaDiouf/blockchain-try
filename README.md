# blockchain-try
Learning tool to understand how blockchains work, the structure of blocks and chains, and the basics of implementing a decentralized ledger using Python and Flask.

Users can send transactions between addresses (sender to recipient), Users can mine new blocks in the blockchain by solving a proof-of-work problem , Users can retrieve the entire blockchain to see the history of blocks and transactions.

How it works? 

- Users send POST requests to add transactions to the blockchain, which are stored temporarily until they are included in the next mined block.
- Mining a block involves solving a proof-of-work challenge, which enhances security and prevents easy manipulation of the blockchain.
- Users can view the entire blockchain to see all transactions that have occurred.
